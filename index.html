			<p class="description">This was my Udacity Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project. In it, you are a treasure hunter seeking to find 8 gems in a maze full of malicious baddies. Armed with your trusty raygun, you must find a way to exit safely with as many gems as possible. Developed for Google Cardboard on Unity, and tested on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.</p>
